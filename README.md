MazeTric
========

A simple maze-traversal game, written in C++. Utilizes BGI. 

Note: The game utilizes BGI (Borland Graphics Interface), and therefore is unsupported by most modern compilers like GCC,
Microsoft C/C++ compiler etc. I recommend using a DOS emulator (I use DOSBox).

The Editor (SRC_EDT) is where you make your maze and save it. The maze can be loaded and played using SRC_MAZE. 

The plan is to re-write it using SFML, and to add more features.

Note: Make a copy of the maze file before playing it, and replace the original (now changed) with the copy later. The 
next version will default this.
